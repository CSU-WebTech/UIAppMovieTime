# UIAppMovieTime

Initial Proposal was as below:

In this project we will build a website named – Movie Time. This application provides information related to movies/shows and all details of the movie/show that the user searches for.It includes information about the trending and latest releases.
We are using one of the bootstrap templates from the start bootstrap website.Totally we will implement three web pages one is the home page,other is search page and trending movies page. The user lands on the homepage with the movie time application caption. The landing page tells briefly as to what information can be obtained from this application. They can explore data related to films.  The user can further navigate to the Trending tab where they can get to view movies which are Fan Favorites, Top box office and Coming soon to theaters. 
The user can also search all details about a movie/show by providing the search keyword of the movie/show by navigating to the Search Movie tab. The user can provide the input as the title of the movie/show and get all the details in the search results like movie poster, release year etc. We are using OMDB API to retrieve this user specific search information.

We have tried to cover all possible aspects of what we proposed initially  for the project.
